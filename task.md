Assignment: Email Inbox Organizer

Overview

Build an intelligent email inbox organizer that automatically categorizes, prioritizes, and suggests actions for incoming emails. The system should help users manage their inbox more efficiently by providing smart organization and actionable insights.

Objective

Develop a production-ready application that demonstrates your ability to:

·       Build multi-agent AI systems using modern agentic frameworks

·       Create intuitive user interfaces with Streamlit

·       Process and analyse unstructured text data

·       Implement intelligent decision-making workflows

·       Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code

 

Requirements: Core Functionality

Your application must:

Ø  Email Organization

·       Automatically categorize emails into meaningful categories

·       Assign priority levels to help users focus on what matters

·       Extract key information from email content

Ø  Action Recommendations

·       Suggest appropriate actions for each email (reply, schedule meeting, archive, etc.)

·       Provide reasoning for recommendations

·       Generate draft responses where applicable

Ø  User Interface (Streamlit)

·       Display emails in an organized, filterable view

·       Show categorization and priority for each email

·       Present action suggestions clearly

·       Allow filtering by category, priority, sender, or date range

·       Provide search functionality

Ø  Architecture

·       Implement using an agentic AI framework (e.g., LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, Google ADK, etc.)

·       Design with multiple specialized agents coordinating to accomplish tasks

·       Ensure proper error handling and logging

Ø  Bonus Features (Optional)

·       Voice Integration: Implement bidirectional voice streaming using Google ADK or similar

·       Voice queries: “Show me urgent emails from this week”

·       Voice commands: “Archive all newsletters”

·       Bulk actions capability

·       Email threading/conversation grouping

·       Sentiment analysis

·       Custom category creation

Ø  Dataset

·       You will be provided with a CSV file (emails_dataset.csv) containing 100 sample emails with the following structure:

·       email_id: Unique identifier

·       sender_email: Email address of sender

·       sender_name: Name of sender

·       subject: Email subject line

·       body: Email content

·       timestamp: When email was received (ISO format)

·       has_attachment: Boolean indicating attachments

·       thread_id: Identifier for email conversations

Ø  Deliverables

·       Source Code

o   Well-organized codebase with clear structure

o   Requirements.txt or equivalent dependency file

o   README.md with setup instructions

·       Running Application

o   Fully functional Streamlit application

o   Clear instructions to run locally

·       Documentation

o   Architecture overview explaining your agent design

o   Brief explanation of framework choice and approach

o   Any assumptions or design decisions made

·       Demo Video (Optional)

o   3-5 minute walkthrough of your application

o   Highlight key features and decision-making process

 

Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on:

·       Functionality (40%): Does the system work as expected? Are emails properly categorized and prioritized?

·       Architecture (25%): Effective use of multi-agent systems and agentic frameworks

·       Code Quality (20%): Clean, readable, maintainable code with proper error handling

·       User Experience (10%): Intuitive and polished Streamlit interface

·       Documentation (5%): Clear setup instructions and architecture explanation
